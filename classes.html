                      <p> I have put a furry yellow bean bag in my sons room. He always sleeps on it instead of his bed. It's the cutest thing ever.</p>

                      <p> Bought a reclining couch. It's the brightest peace of furniture in the whole house. </p>

                      <p> I'm overwhelmed by this colour. I wish you had it in mustard or a muddy yellow instead.</p>
